  00
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      Terminates queue processing.
  
  04
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      Same as op 2C, but using the table at FF0CB8 as the command source.
      This version transfers a smaller number of bytes.
          * 94 07 93 3B -- set DMA length to 73B (E76)
          * 96 DE 95 05 -- set DMA source to 7FDE05 (FFBC0A)
          * 97 7F
          * 63 0A       -- trigger DMA: dst = VRAM E30A (plane A area)
          * 00 83
          * 63 0A 00 03 -- set up VRAM write: dst = VRAM E30A
          * 00 FF BC 0A -- pointer; the long at FFBC0A is written to VDP data.
                           (This writes the first word of input a second time,
                           the standard workaround for the VDP bug that
                           causes the first word of certain Mega CD DMA
                           transfers to sometimes get lost.)
  
  08
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      Same as op 2C, but using the table at FF0CCE as the command source.
      This version transfers a smaller number of bytes to the plane B area.
          * 94 07 93 3B -- set DMA length to 73B (E76)
          * 96 E5 95 45 -- set DMA source to 7FE545 (FFCA8A)
          * 97 7F
          * 71 8A       -- trigger DMA: dst = VRAM F18A (plane B area)
          * 00 83
          * 71 8A 00 03 -- set up VRAM write: dst = VRAM F18A
          * 00 FF CA 8A -- pointer; the long at FFCA8A is written to VDP data.
                           (This writes the first word of input a second time,
                           the standard workaround for the VDP bug that
                           causes the first word of certain Mega CD DMA

  0C
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * Writes the long at FFD500 to VRAM FC00.
      * Writes the long at FFDC52 to VSRAM 0000.
  
  10
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * DMA transfers palettes at FFD944 to CRAM. The full 0x80-byte palette
        is copied.
  
  14
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * Retrieves the word at FFDC4C and adds 1. This value is then written to
        FFD93E.
      * Quadruples the value derived in the previous step, then sets to this
        result the DMA length in the table used for the following step.
      * Executes a tabular DMA (see op 2C) that transfers the sprite attribute
        table to VDP. The variable-length data at FFD9C4 is written to VRAM
        E000.
          * 94 ?? 93 ?? -- set DMA length to a nonconstant value
          * 96 EC 95 E2 -- set DMA source to 7FECE2 (FFD9C4)
          * 97 7F
          * 60 00       -- trigger DMA: dst = VRAM E000 (sprite table)
          * 00 83
          * 60 00 00 03 -- set up VRAM write: dst = VRAM E000
          * 00 FF D9 C4 -- pointer; the long at FFD9C4 is written to VDP data.
                           (This writes the first word of input a second time,
                           the standard workaround for the VDP bug that
                           causes the first word of certain Mega CD DMA
                           transfers to sometimes get lost.)

      4b DMA source address
      2b DMA destination VRAM address
      2b DMA transfer length, pre-halved
    Effect:

  24 delayedDmaEnable?
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * ORs the byte at FFD909 with 0x40. Opposite effect of op 28.
  
  28 delayedDmaDisable?
    Parameters: none

      * ANDs the byte at FFD909 with 0xBF. Opposite effect of op 24.
  
  2C
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * Enables DMA, if not already on, for the duration of this operation.
      * Reads data from the table at FF0CE4 in RAM (this is prebaked data from
      MSTART.BIN) and writes it to VDP.
        The table contains the following values, all but the last of which
        are written to the VDP verbatim.
          * 94 0E 93 7B -- set DMA length to E7B (1CF6)
          * 96 DE 95 05 -- set DMA source to 7FDE05 (FFBC0A)
          * 97 7F
          * 63 0A       -- trigger DMA: dst = VRAM E30A (plane A area)
          * 00 83
          * 63 0A 00 03 -- set up VRAM write: dst = VRAM E30A
          * 00 FF BC 0A -- pointer; the long at FFBC0A is written to VDP data.
                           (This writes the first word of input a second time,
                           the standard workaround for the VDP bug that
                           causes the first word of certain Mega CD DMA
                           transfers to sometimes get lost.)
  
  30 -- immediateDmaEnable?
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * ORs the word at FFD908 with 0x40. Opposite effect of op 34.
      * Also writes this updated value to VDP control port.
  
  34 -- immediateDmaDisable?
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * ANDs the word at FFD908 with 0xFFBF. Opposite effect of op 30.
      * Also writes this updated value to VDP control port.
