================================================================================

  00
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      Gives ownership of WRAM to sub-CPU.

  04
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      Gives ownership of WRAM to sub-CPU.

  08
    Parameters: none
    Effect: none

  0C
    Parameters: none
    Effect: none

  10
    Parameters:
      2b <??>
    Effect:
      * Writes <??> to (A1).
      * Sets A1 to (0x80,A1).

  14
    Parameters:
      2b <size> -- if zero, treat as 0x2000
    Effect:
      * ANDs FFD909 with 0xBF (DMA disable??)
      * Waits for FFD900 to change value (vblank?)
      * Runs VDP command 0x20 (DMA transfer to VRAM) with parameters:
        src = 0x23FF32 + 0x200000
        dst = 0000
        size = <size>
      * ORs FFD909 with 0x40 (DMA enable??)
      * Clears FFD900 and FFD902 (???)
      * Sets FFD940 to (23FF3C), which contains the first 4 characters of the
        name of the file that graphics were most recently loaded from.
        Perhaps for debugging purposes?

  18
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * Uploads any pending patterns to VRAM.
        Pending pattern transfers are stored in a list at 23CB00; entries
        are of the format:
          * 2b dst tile index
          * 2b src tile index (?)
        The list is terminated by a dst index of 0000.
        Pattern data start is pointed to by 23FF32.
      * ??? more pattern copies?
      * Updates nametable scrolling?
      * ???

  1C
    Parameters:
      (optional) 1b <unk>
    Effect:
      * Calls a routine that:
        * Sets A1 to FFBC00
        * Adds (A4) to A1
        * ???
      * If <unk> does not exist (is 0x80), D0 and A0 are cleared and execution
        jumps to address 12C10
      * If <unk> does exist:
        * F704 is added to <unk>, and the result is written to F718
        * The modified <unk> is then used to look up an entry in the table of
          longs pointed to by F15C. Only the low 24 bits of the entry are
          read.
          * F706 is added to this value, and F71C is subtracted from it.
          * This results in a value, <address>. FF is written to <address + 8>.
          * #FFFF is written to 12C14.
          * <address + 0x12> is ANDed with 0x7F.
          * 12C10 is then called as a subroutine.

  20
    Parameters: none
    Effect: none

  24
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * Waits until FFD902 becomes less than or equal to FFD900
      
  28
    Parameters: none
    Effect:
      * ???
      * Returns (FFD92C & 0xFF00) as a word in communication RAM. This may fail
        and return nothing (no value written) under some circumstance.
      
  30
    Parameters:
      1b <value>
    Effect:
      * If <value> >= 0x10, calls 0xFF3008 (sound driver API call 2) and clears
        FFD930
      * Otherwise:
        * Uses <value> as an index into the word table at FF0BBE, then adds
          the value at FF3900 to the looked-up value to form <sndParam>.
        * Sets FFD930 to #FFFF.
        * Calls 0xFF3004 (sound driver API call 1) with a parameter
          of 0xFFFF, then calls 0xFF3004 again with a parameter of <sndParam>.
